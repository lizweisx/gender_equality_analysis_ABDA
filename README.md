# Applied Bayesian Data Analysis: Gender Equality and Economic Growth

## Project Overview
This project explores the impact of gender equality laws on economic growth using Bayesian models, focusing on mechanisms like female labor participation and education. It includes a comparison of outcomes across regions and economic levels.

## Research Questions
- Does legal gender equality promote economic growth (e.g., GDP growth rate)?
- Possible mechanisms linking gender-equal laws to GDP:
   - Female labor force participation: How do laws encourage women to join the workforce? 
   - Social welfare effects: How does gender equality improve education and health, driving long-term growth?
   - Are the effects of gender-equal laws on GDP different across economies with varying legal and economic contexts?


## Methodology
- **Dataset**: World Bank WBL 1.0 data (1971–2024), covering 190 economies.
- **Models**:
  - Generalized Linear Models (GLM) or Non-linear Models (Depends on data distribution, haven't decided yet)
  - Multilevel Models
