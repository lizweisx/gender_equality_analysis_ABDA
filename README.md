# Analyzing the Economic Impact of Gender Equality Across Countries

  This repository contains the code and analysis for our project in **Advanced Bayesian Data Analysis**, where we explore the relationship between gender equality and economic growth using **Bayesian multilevel modeling**.

  ## Project Overview

  - **Objective**: Investigate how gender equality indicators (e.g., WBL Index, female labor force participation, education) influence GDP across countries.
  - **Methodology**: Bayesian hierarchical modeling using the `brms` package in R.
  - **Data Source**: [World Bank datasets (1991-2022)](https://data.worldbank.org/).
  - **Key Findings**: Gender equality impacts GDP differently based on income levels and regions.
